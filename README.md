# Cloud Concepts
## ==========================DAY-1==============================  

### Essentials of a Business Applictaion**
In order to Develop a E-commerce web Applications:
the resources required are:
1. Compute  - Servers, to process and the run the web applications.
2. Database -  To store data of your users and sales details.
3. Storage  - To store images and vedios of the products.
4. Networking - To allow users to connect to web application.
5. Security  - To prevent the data theft of your data.  

**Advantages of Cloud**
* Elasticity - The Ability to adopt to workload cahnges (usually dynamic,short-term) .
  Eg: During Fifa world Cup, Streaming Applications Handling huge spike of traffic by increasing servers. 
* Scalability - The Ability to handle increased workloads by adding resources (usually static,long-term) .
  Eg: scale up the database because the size has grown over time.
* High Availability - The Ability to continue functioning even if some components fail. 
  Eg: when a power outage causes one data center to go down ,traffic is routed to another data center.
* Realiability - The Ability to function consistently and correctly when expected/all the time.
  Eg: The services are running 24/7 and are available i.e. 99.99% uptime EC2 instance 
* Agility - The Ability to rapidly develop, test and launch applications to deliver business value.
  Eg: Launching a Business Application in days rather than a month.
* Global reach - The ability to get closer to your customers through a global infrastrcucture.
  Eg: AWS provides 25 Availability Zones around the world and it may incresre in future.
* pay-as-you-go pricing - only pay for what you use and use only when you need it.
  Eg: An EC2 instance is used for 2 hours; only pay for 2 hours.
* Economies of Scale - Because of their huge size,AWS can buy things more cheaply than an individual organization can.
  Eg: Amazon purchases servers at a fraction of the cost that you could, and pass the savings on to you
 ### AWS ECONOMICS
 
 **CapEx & OpEx** 
 Capital Expenses - Intial cost spent to buy hardware(H/W) and software(S/W)
 Operationsl Expenses - Cost spent to Maintainance of S/W & H/W , Electricity, A/C, IT Employees hiring & Training.
 **on-premises Infrastructure:**
 *on-premises infrastructure = CapEx + OpEx*
 **Cloud Infrastructure:**
 *Cloud infrastructure = <50% of OpEx*
 OpEx includes only Subscription fee 
 
 **Reduce Costs in AWS**
* Right Sized Infrastructure - Right Number & Kind of machines,turn on/off occasional services.
* Automation - Schedule start and stop times for servers (in case of nights,weekends,events)
* Complaince Scope - Service level PCI(Payment Card Industry) complaince
* Managed Services - use the service without worrying about creating the servers,installation and licensing cost and so on.

### Foundational services in AWS
* Compute -Elastic Compute(EC2)
* Database - Relational Database Service(RDS) & DynamoDB(NoSQL)
* Storage - Simple Storage Service(S3)
* Networking - Virtual Private Network(VPC)
* Security - Identity & Access Management(IAM)
